add a :hover effect of underline, black, trasition from the middle outward for each li element.
make use of %placeholders / @extend.

go back in your senteces that you are inserting and add "" + "" + "" around your skill words such as html, css, angular, etc.
rewrite your line high values as 1.5 or other numbers, this will be 1.5 imes larger than the font size of the current element.
go back and apply shorthand properties to your font: styling. style weight size/lineheight family, serif;
go back and aply short hand to your padding, margin, and border as well in case you have not done so already.
go back and rewrite your margin to auto, that way your text will me centerered in the middle of the screen.
go back and redoo your margin, padding, and position, rigbt now you may be using one when you should be using another.
go back and apply box-sixing: border-box to any elements you were working with width and or hieght in. Apply it to the * {} universal selector would get the job done.
