    I\’ve had many foes (courses) for which I have vanquished (completed). A few of these villains, more of rights of passage, go by the names of Html, CSS, and Javascript. \
    All of which I have faced single-handedly. However, my most recent nemesis goes by the name of..Ajax... I thought to myself its time to even the scales, \
    while consulting the librarians of \"Jquery\"(other programmer\'s on Quora), I was made aware of a tomb not far from here that presented a certain framework not that could aid in my holy crusade as a developer;\
    that place was known as \"Angular\". In order to weave my way back through the darkness, I had to use a very sacred and \"Sassy\" compass. \
    Using the compasses powers to escape the coming darkness(deadlines) that was chasing me through the tomb(Angular), without a moment\'s notice I was free, \
    standing in the light of the sun(goal date) for what felt like the first time ever. Even though I am still walking the path of Padawan, \
    there is more than meets the eye to this transformer. \
    To further my Frontend superpowers I\’ve decided to devote myself to learning the ancient \"Type\" scripts to find any information I can on these special Hierographics I noticed from my previous adventures from before written in a language called \"D3\" while in the tombs of Angular. \
    What seems to be a prophecy I\'ve heard whispers of a Necessary evil, and \"Ionicly\" It is a way to create mobile applications with the skills I have already added to my arsenal.";

    the bells ring of success, and knowledge ours for the taking, yet only if one was willing to apply themselves enough in their studies could these Premonitions come to pass. \
    Being a 100% self-motivated, dedicated, and remote cadet(student) with the hopes and dreams of one day joining a Enterprise crew of his own as an Engineer. \
    The first lessons to be learnt(at codecadmey) were what all must become familiar with, no matter what the intentions, Html and CSS. \
    Upon completing the early years of a newbie one could then move on to officer school(Team Treehouse), entitling many studies of the ancient teachings in \"Javascript\" while at the same time walking the great halls in the \"Jquery\" Library. \
    The next task was to skirmish with a fellow student at the time, \"Ajax\", who had requested me to go to the forbidden section(backend) to obtain some basic information. \
    While amongst other languages and artefacts unknown to most mortal eyes(PhP, MySQL and Laravel) they seemed to speak the name..Angular. \
    I had decided I was to seek out this one known as \"Angular\", and dance the dance of matrimony, becoming one with the force(Angular), potentially never having to go to that place again(backend). \
    Luckily I had brought my newly found \"Sassy\" \"compass\" with me to help find my way through the boring halls back into the light of Frontendtopia.";

    From working in strict Javascript to typing out fully extensible Html is what you will see incorporated throughout my work. \
    You will also notice that once I have been taught to stick with a specific kind of a style on a project, I tend to stick with it until completion, \
    this smooths out the processes for other developers who are and will be working on the same codebase. I currently reside in the rolling hills of Knoxville TN. \
    I\'ve been conscious on this earth for nearly 23 years and I look forward to growing that number into eternity. \
    At this point, I am interested in joining a company of fellow crime fighters I can grow with and believe and just may very well be located in a far off land, as long as my future comrades would be willing to summon me(relocation assistance) that is. \
    A team that won\’t only have my back but one that I can have \“back\” as well. Fellow Engineers, I get along with and can brainstorm alongside are also amazing traits I cherish in a strike force as well as solid communication to and from the UI/UX\'ers. \
    I am quite familiar with the native dialects of Git; Git-Flow, Github, Cloud 9 and Screen Hero. If a service such as Skype would be required for an interview, at first, I would be able to transition quickly as I already carry a secret password that was given by the order of Skype, \
    bestowing to me their power of virtual confrontation.";
